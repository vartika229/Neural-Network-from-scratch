# Neural-Network-from-scratch
Designed and implemented a fully functional feedforward neural network from scratch using only core Python libraries (e.g., NumPy). The model was trained and evaluated on standard datasets (MNIST). Emphasis was placed on understanding and visualizing internal network operations, tuning hyperparameters, and ensuring numerical stability.

#**Install Requirements**
python 3.0,
numpy,
jupyter notebook,
scikit-learn (for testing our model).
