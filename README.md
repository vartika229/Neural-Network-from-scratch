# Neural-Network-from-scratch
Designed and implemented a fully functional feedforward neural network from scratch using only NumPy. The model was trained and evaluated on a standard Iris dataset. 
I used Categorical Cross Entropy loss function since it is a multi-class problem, along with activation function that uses ReLu + Softmax activation. 
ReLu introduces non-linearity, allowing the Network to learn complex patterns.
Softmax is only used in the output layer to get the predicted probability of each class.
I also used He normal initialisation, since it pairs nicely with ReLu.

#**Install Requirements**
Python 3.0,
Numpy,
Networkx (optional; for visualizing the network),
Scikit-learn (for testing our model).
